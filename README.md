## 🔮 Roadmap

- Adding Options for 2v8 (Killer and Survivor) as well as Chaos Mode
- Adding killers as they are added into the game
- Adding a feature to choose custom images for the characters rather the default placeholders that are currently there
- Potential Notes for each role/killer to allow input and include things such as the build you used
- Add the option to have an animation appear as an overlay for when an action happens, such as adding a win to the counter, losing or setting a new personal best (will be configuarble in a settings menu)
- Potential local achievements for reaching certain milestones (Unlikely)
